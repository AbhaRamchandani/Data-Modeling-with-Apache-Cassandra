# Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Create an Apache Cassandra database which can query song play data to answer questions on user activity and app log.

# Available information
#1 - Dataset: /event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date.

#2 - Template files
(i) Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb - project template (a Jupyter notebook file), which will be completed to create the database, sparkify
(ii) /images/image_event_datafile_new.jpg - image for structure of event_datafile_new.csv that will be generated

# Setup Instructions
For this project, I used the Udacity workspace.

I imported all the relevant libraries, set up appropriate connections to the database. This was done within the Jupyter Notebook template provided.

# Program execution
Run each cell of the Jupyter notebook - Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb. Executing the notebook will create the CSV file, event_datafile_new.csv, with all the relevant data - aggregate of all event_data files.
    
# Testing the program
The Jupyter notebook, Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb, contains appropriate select statements to test the code

# Reference
